/**
 * Atoms
 * All the atoms styling.
 * An atom is the most basic component. It cannot contain any other atoms or anything else and have to be context free, meaning that
 * it need to be usable everywhere we want without having to deal with pre-defined margins, etc...
 * All atoms specific classes have to start with `.a-`.
